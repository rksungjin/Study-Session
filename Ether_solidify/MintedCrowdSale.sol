/** This is an assignment to create a smart contract that allows you to run your own token crowdsale.
 *  Your contract will mint your custom token every time a purchase is made by your or your classmates.
 *  We've provided you with the pseudocode and some hints to guide you in the right direction.
 *  Make sure to implement the best practices you learned during the Solidity Walkthrough segment.
 *  Check for errors by compiling often. Ask your classmates for help - we highly encourage student collaboration.
 *  You should be able to deploy your crowdsale contract onto the Rinkeby testnet and buy/sell your classmates' tokens.
